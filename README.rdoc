This application uses ruby 2.2.0 and Rails 4.2.11.1

The purpose of this application is to function as a message board that allows replies to posts.  Only the user who created the post or comment can edit or delete it.  Error checking is in place to prevent users who are not signed in to create posts or comments.

The 3 new gems I used in this were Simple Form, Devise, and bootstrap-sass.
